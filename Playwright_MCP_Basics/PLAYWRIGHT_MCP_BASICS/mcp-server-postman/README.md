# MCP Server: jsonplaceholder-api

This is an advanced MCP (Model-Context Protocol) server generated automatically from a Postman Collection. It is
designed to be flexible, robust, and easy to use.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Transport Modes**: Can run over HTTP with stateful sessions, as a simple stateless HTTP API, or over local
STDIO.
- **Recursive Tool Loading**: Automatically discovers and loads tool files from the `tools/` directory and all its
subdirectories.
- **Smart Schema Handling**: Correctly handles tools that do not require any input arguments.
- **Dynamic and Extensible**: Easily add new tools by dropping `.js` files into the `tools/` directory.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

First, install the required dependencies:


npm install


### 2. Configuration

Create a `.env` file by copying the example provided:

cp .env.example .env



Open the `.env` file to configure the `PORT` and add any necessary API keys or other secrets your tools might need.
These variables are available in your tool handlers via `process.env`.

.env file
PORT=3000
API_KEY=your_secret_key_here


### 3. Running the Server

This server was generated to run in **`stdio`** mode. See below for instructions specific to this mode.

#### Mode: `stdio` (For Local Command-Line Tools)

This mode is ideal for local development and integration with other command-line tools.

**To run the server:**
Use `node` to execute the server script directly. This bypasses `npm` and ensures a clean communication channel, which
is **required** for STDIO.

node server.js



The server will now listen for MCP JSON-RPC messages on standard input and write responses to standard output.
Human-readable logs are sent to `stderr` so they do not interfere.

#### Mode: `http-stateless` (Simple, Sessionless API)

This mode exposes a simple, sessionless HTTP endpoint. Every request is independent and processed immediately.

**To run the server:**
npm start



The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000/mcp` (or on the port specified in your `.env` file). Send `POST`
requests with MCP `tools/call` payloads directly. No session management is needed.

#### Mode: `http-session` (Stateful, Manages User Sessions)

This mode exposes a full-featured, stateful HTTP endpoint that manages user sessions. It is ideal for complex,
multi-turn interactions with an AI model.

**To run the server:**
npm start

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.

**Session Workflow:**
1. **Initialize**: A client must first send a `POST` request with an `initialize` message to start a session. The
response will contain a `Mcp-Session-Id` header.
2. **Interact**: Use this `Mcp-Session-Id` header in all subsequent `POST` (tool calls) or `GET` (streaming) requests to
interact with the same session.
3. **Terminate**: Send a `DELETE` request with the session ID to close the session.

*This mode also supports stateless `tools/call` requests (sent without a session ID) for one-shot operations.*

## Project Structure

- `server.js`: The main entry point and server logic.
- `tools/`: The directory where all your generated tools live. You can organize tools in subfolders.
- `.env`: Your environment-specific configuration file.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool, simply create a new `.js` file inside the `tools/` directory (or any of its subdirectories). The
server will automatically discover and register it on the next startup. Each tool file should export the following
properties: `name`, `title`, `description`, `inputSchema`, and `handler`.
